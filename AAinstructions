First I worked on the front end -client
run npm init
then npx create-react-app client 
this installed packages like , react , react,dom ,react-scprit with cra-template 
//
Success! Created client at C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN\client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
//this two creates a new server for me to see my code .
  cd client
  npm start

Happy hacking!
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN> npm client
Unknown command: "client"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.69:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
//
for css , used tailwindcss
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN> cd client
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN\client> npm i tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
