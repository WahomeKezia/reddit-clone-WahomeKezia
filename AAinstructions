First I worked on the front end -client
run npm init
then npx create-react-app client 
this installed packages like , react , react,dom ,react-scprit with cra-template 
//
Success! Created client at C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN\client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
//this two creates a new server for me to see my code .
  cd client
  npm start

Happy hacking!
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN> npm client
Unknown command: "client"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.69:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
//
for css , used tailwindcss
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN> cd client
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN\client> npm i tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9

then npm i craco to add styles 
edit package.json to add craco 
to create a config for tailwindcss do:
the npx tailwindcss init

i had an issue here because my terminal kept saying the webpack version has issues and the version is not the latest 
also an issue with the tree

i used heroicons for my interface icons 
npm i @heroicons/react

I faced this problem 
PS C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\REDDIT-CLONE-ASSIGN\reddit-clone-WahomeKezia\client> npm i react-clickout-handler

my react-clickout-handler wasn't installing , 
I typeed: npm config set legacy-peer-deps true 
and the issues resolves 
reference from stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67645342/npm-install-fails-unable-to-resolve-dependency-tree

for the log in and sign up , i set up my Api and run the following command
cd api , npm init 
npm i express, body-parser, cookie-parser ,cors , moongose ,dotenv 
////yarn uses a different approach 
then set up the package.json by adding type:module and "dev":server.js 
then run npm run dev and nodemon start running , 
you can use postman to test your API or open the port on the server
